	abstract = {We describe a method for point and interval estimation of population parameters from complex surveys using estimating functions. The theory was originally developed for infinite populations and has recently been applied to finite populations. With estimating functions, a unifying framework can be given for point and interval estimation of both finite and infinite population parameters. We discuss test inversion methods to derive confidence intervals for one-dimensional parameters and propose a method for eliminating nuisance parameters in the multidimensional setting. We show that special cases of our proposal result in conditional and orthogonal methods proposed in the literature. We describe a simulation study using real data to compare the coverage probabilities of confidence intervals obtained under various approaches.},

This article gives expressions for the spatial interpolation errors in terms of the statistics of the component fields, which enable us to assess the relative importance of different kinds of uncertainty. This modeling approach is applied to data of sulfur dioxide concentrations in Europe, and a comparison with neighborhood kriging is done by means of cross-validation.},

The theory was originally developed for infinite populations and has recently been applied to finite populations. With estimating functions, a unifying framework can be given for point and interval estimation of both finite and infinite population parameters. We discuss test inversion methods to derive confidence intervals for one-dimensional parameters and propose a method for eliminating nuisance parameters in the multidimensional setting. We show that special cases of our proposal result in conditional and orthogonal methods proposed in the literature. We describe a simulation study using real data to compare the coverage probabilities of confidence intervals obtained under various approaches.},
