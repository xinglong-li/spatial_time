# Preferential Sampling in Environmental Networks

This package present a general framework for detecting the preferential sampling in an environmental
process across space and/or time.

This is based on the work [A general theory for preferential sampling in environmental networks](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-13/issue-4/A-general-theory-for-preferential-sampling-in-environmental-networks/10.1214/19-AOAS1288.full)
by Joe Watson, James V. Zidek and Gavin Shaddick.
This is achieved by considering the joint distribution of an environmental process with a site-selection
process that considers where and when sites are placed to measure the process.
The environmental process may be spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal in nature.
By sharing random effects between the two processes, the joint model is able to establish whether
site placement was stochastically dependent of the environmental process under study.
