\section{PM10 in California}

\subsection{The data}
A few data cleaning steps were carried out before fitting the models. Due to the right skewness of 
the PM10 observation distribution, we applied the natural logarithmic transformation to the values
to make the observation more Gaussian in shape. Before the log transformation, we firstly divide
each value by mean of all recorded values to make the response dimensionless.
We scale the Eastings and Northings coordinates and the unit is 100 km. We scaled the years to
lie in the interval $[0, 1]$ to stabilize the temporal polynomials used in later analysis.

\subsection{Modeling}
We build one model from the general framework introduced earlier.
