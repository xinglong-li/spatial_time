\section{Introduction}
\cite{Watson2019_pref_samp} proposed a framework that jointly modeling the distribution of an
environmental process and a site-selection process, where the environmental process can be spatial,
temporal, or spatio-temporal. By sharing the random effects between the two process, the joint
model can detect the preferential sampling effects.

In this work, we develop an R package for this joint model framework for the purpose of making
spatial predictions. We demonstrate this R package by applying it to the modeling and prediction of
PM10 distributions in California.
